Hi all,

Please find an attached matlab script.
This returns subtracted image (raw data as well if you want).
[data, thresh]=loadhdf5(imname) gives you both images and data=loadhdf5(imname) subtracted images only.
Data is subtracted images.
Thresh is a structure with thresh.low and thresh.high.
If you leave imname as blank, then it will read all hdf5 files in the folder and make them as stacks.
Please let me know if you have questions.

Wonsuk
